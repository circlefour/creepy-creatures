welcome to the first installment of creepy creatures build a face tracking robot.
we'll be learning the basics of how to wire components up to an arduino, use serial to communicate between devices, and trigger movements based on received data.
all arduino starter code is provided in the associated directory.

[face tracker](https://tracker-peach-sigma.vercel.app/)

the above link makes use of the [mediapipe javascript library for computer vision](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/setup_web)
as well as the [web serial api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API#browser_compatibility) to communicate between our computers and the arduino / servo attached.
this api is only supported on chrome, opera, and edge browsers.
